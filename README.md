Understanding distinct parts of an image is a crucial part of solving computer vision problems. Image segmentation is one such problem of computer vision. It is a step beyond object detection. In object detection when an image is sent to the computer, it classifies the objects in the image with labels and pinpoints the location of the objects with bounding boxes. In image segmentation, the objects are identified on a pixel-level. Each pixel of an object is identified and classified as a pixel of that object. In other words, the task of image segmentation is to identify which pixel belongs to which object. In this project, images were masked on a pixel-level using an architecture called UNet.
